Using machine learning approach, I predicated the classe variables
dependency on other variables using regression tree and random forests.
Please refer to .rmd and .html files for details. Along with .rmd and
.html files,I have also submitted five figures as .png files. The
calculated out-of samples error were approximately 25% and 0.2%. These
calculations show that random forests is well fitted for predication.
The comparision between Figure 3 and Figure 5 also shows that random
forests makes less mistake in the prediction.
